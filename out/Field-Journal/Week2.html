<p>Ended up hitting many roadblocks with Lab 2, mainly not understanding what the 'metal' was. I went through obtaining a USB drive and attempting to rework it to having the .iso file and running my mac from the startup help with it, but it never showed up. I got everything installed through parallels, and I attempted to use a VPS through <a href="http://tilaa.com">tilaa.com</a>. No idea if this is the best way to do it, but it was the cheapest option for a VPS and I saw that mentioned as a reason to skip the metal portion of the lab. I looked through my classmates posts, and they were helpful in getting me through a couple of the steps, and knowing that I wasn't alone with my struggles. Here are the pictures of the progress I made through Lab 2.</p>

<h4 id="lab-3">Lab 3</h4>
<p>The CRUD challenge posed a new challenge as I have no experience with Apache. I have used mysql before, but I was tripping myself up with not setting a root password and running into errors. To actually use the apache2 server, I went into the /var/www/html directory and added the files from the github to it. I attempted to download VScode, and that ended up being a struggle because I could only get to access to a few files and I had to figure out that having the ARM vs AMD was an issue. Eventually I found a guide that helped out a lot and it was downloaded. I had to create files from the terminal and then save within VScode with sudo privileges.</p>

<p>Boundaries of what's acceptable</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud server that you're going to work on (nginx)
<ul>
<li>Secure the server</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deploy some sort of service on there
<ul>
<li>his example was nextCloud</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Inspired by another student using an application they have built. They took a Lacrosse Camp registration service and chose to utilize github and buildkite to test and deploy. Look into what buildkite is and see if it sparks anything.</p>
<p>Potential Ideas for My Research Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use roundcube in the loser-league to operate as an email rundown/forgotten password service/yearly or weekly reminder</li>
<li>Use Jenkins integration with github as an automated testing tool</li>
<li>Change the storage to the Regis Cloud or some other Cloud storage for all the data</li>
<li>Change the REST API to use GraphQL</li>
<li>Selenium testing?</li>
</ul>

<p>This week was disheartening in that I had such a hard time with all of Lab 2. I definitely struggled to make sense of what my errors were, and most of my errors lead to internet rabbit holes with no concrete answers. I was helped along the way by my classmates. They encountered similar issues, and it was very helpful to look at their various solutions. I was proud of myself when I finally got VScode downloaded, and the CRUD challenge completed, because at the start I was not very successful and I was starting to get those familiar feelings from Lab 2 that no matter what I did I would not make any real progress. But I felt very rewarded with seeing something tangible and knowing that I have at least gotten something correct with these first few labs. For next week I hope to be much less late with all of my work.</p>
