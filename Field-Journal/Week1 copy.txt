## Weekly Notes
### Class Documents Notes
Research Project general stages:
1. Setup and configure Linux Server OS, virtual
2. Setup and configure Linux Server OS (metal)
   1. Note: Setup and configure will include LAMP stack and server hardening
3. Build and install private-cloud service (next cloud), and public-cloud services (website)
4. Build and configure second server (metal)
   1. Note: We will explore using a tool called ansible which is an orchestration tool to help manage our servers
5. Install NGinx and failover
6. Designing architecture for service-oriented and/or microservices deployment
   1. Note: We may modify these stages based on our progress

Research Questions: You will write no less than two, no more than five questions for your project

Potential Ideas for My Research Project:
- Use roundcube in the loser-league to operate as an email rundown/forgotten password service/yearly or weekly reminder
- Use Jenkins integration with github as an automated testing tool

### Linux for Software Engineers Notes
Ubuntu 16 was deprecated, so I am using their official site to download the latest version of Ubuntu Server 18.04.4 LTS.
URL for what I used: https://medium.com/@paulrobu/how-to-run-ubuntu-22-04-vms-on-apple-m1-arm-based-systems-for-free-c8283fb38309

My computer will not allow me to download Oracle Virtual Box

### Class Zoom Notes
Plug to keep up on stuff: Focus more on the architecture than anything else

#### Recipes
Recipes can build on others.
- Try and keep them 10 steps or less

#### Research project
Look at the 6 stages in the document (researchProjectAndResearchQuestions)

Part of it had to be E2E.

Boundaries of what's acceptable
- Cloud server that you're going to work on (nginx)
  - Secure the server
- Deploy some sort of service on their
  - his example was nextCloud

#### Lab
Share what you've been working on in class pre the lab

### Reading Notes

#### Runeson Ch. 1
1.1 What is a case study?
- An approach to research that studies a phenomenon in its natural setting
1.2 A brief history of case studies in software engineering
1.3 Why a book on case studies in software engineering?
- There are a variety of components and stakeholders in software development that make documenting and understanding the process difficult
  - Three components of a Software Engineering situation:
    - Actor
    - Technology
    - Activity
1.4 Conclusion
- It is important to define guidelines for case study research in software engineering
#### Runeson Ch. 2
2.1 Introduction
- Set out a scheme to help decide when case study is a feasible research approach
2.2 Research Strategies
- 3 different definitions for case study
  - A strategy for doing research that involves an empirical investigation of a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context, using multiple sources of evidence
  - Empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context using multiple sources of evidence
  - A phenomenon in its natural setting, employing multiple methods of data collection to gather information from one or a few entities. The boundaries of the phenomenon are not clearly evident at the outset of the research and no experimental manipulation is involved
- Case study in SE is an empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context using multiple sources of evidence
- 3 main strategies:
  - Survey
  - Experiment
  - Action Research (influence or change some aspect of whatever is the focus of the research)
2.3 Characteristics of Research Strategies
- Purpose
  - 4 general types of purpose
    - Exploratory
    - Descriptive
    - Explanatory
    - Improvising
- Control and Data
  - Constant tradeoff between level of control and degree of realism
  - Data is either quantitative or qualitative
    - Quantitative data is numerical
    - Qualitative data is non-numerical
  - Research process is either fixed or flexible
    - Fixed research process is a pre-defined process
    - Flexible research process is a process that is not pre-defined
- Triangulation
  - Taking multiple perspectives towards the studied object when relying primarily on qualitative data
  - Data (source) triangulation
    - Using more than one source of data or collecting the data at different times
  - Observer triangulation
    - Using more than one observer
  - Methodological triangulation
    - Combining different methods of data collection
  - Theory triangulation
    - Combining different theories
- Replication
  - Transparency that allows others to replicate the research is the sign of trustworthy research
- Inductive and Deductive Enquiries
  - Inductive
    - Theory is induced from the observations
  - Deductive
    - Theory is deduced from existing theory
2.4 What makes a good case study?
- The study of a topic supported by a variety of data sources
2.5 When is the case study strategy feasible?
- When studying a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context, especially when the boundaries between the phenomenon and the context are not clearly evident
2.6 Case study research process
- 5 major process steps
  - Case study design
  - Preparation for data collection
  - Collection of evidence
  - Analysis of collected data
  - Reporting
2.7 Conclusion
- Terminology and definitions vary somewhat, basic concepts lead to establishing a standard

### Lab
Attempted a download of Ubuntu and it didn't really work so I am restarting with Parallels as my virtual machine software.

following a combination of the instructions and my classmates fieldbooks.

## Reflection
So far this week I have finished a few of the tasks. I have posted my introduction, done the reading for the two chapters, and have completed lab 1. While going through the documents for the class, everything made sense, I still do not have an idea for my research project, but I am hopeful that before class on tuesday I will have a couple ideas. I am hoping to figure something out that can answer issues I am having at work, or just be something I've wanted to learn. I am very inexperienced with Linux, and have not done much in Virtual Machines or anything like that. I did my best to download Ubuntu through Parallels on my Mac, and as far as I know it went well. I unfortunately didn't realize what running servers on a "metal" really meant. So I am a little late and need to purchase a USB so I can get underway in the lab 2 assignment. Next week I hope to be more on top of the assignments so I can reach out for help and give myself more time to take a deeper dive into the labs.
